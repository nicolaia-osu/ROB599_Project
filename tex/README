How to use LaTeX (in this directory).

the "./Makefile" makes it so you can do this:
> make
builds the LaTeX document into, among other things, a PDF file. 
> make clean
deletes all the generated documents, leaving only the .tex and .bib files

The .tex file holds the document, including formatting commands.

The .bib file is one way of holding the references we want to
cite. Citations are then made in the .tex document.

Git etiquette: don't commit any generated files, including PDFs,
however tempted you may be. Bill, at least, will get mad at you. This
is because, if you make some changes to the .tex or .bib files but
don't regenerate the PDF, people could pull down the PDF and use that
without questioning anything, thereby getting an outdated file.
